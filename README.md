English | [简体中文](https://github.com/hotjuicew/hugoArticleEncryptor/blob/master/README-zh_CN.md)

hugoArticleEncryptor is a tool for encrypting Hugo articles. It is a Golang version of ⭐[Hugo Encryptor](https://github.com/Li4n0/hugo_encryptor).
It uses the AES-GCM algorithm to encrypt the entire Hugo article, and decrypts the content after the user enters the correct password.
The configuration is very simple. Once you have entered the correct password, you won't need to enter it again when accessing encrypted pages. The decrypted content will be directly displayed.

hugoArticleEncryptor only works on the "posts" folder (or "post" folder) under your "content" directory.
